            <p class="text_p">After their father is murdered under mysterious circumstances, the three Locke siblings and their mother move into their ancestral home, Keyhouse, which they discover is full of magical keys that may be connected to their father's death. As the Locke children explore the different keys and their unique powers, a mysterious demon awakens - and will stop at nothing to steal them. From Carlton Cuse and Meredith Averill, Locke and Key is a coming-of-age mystery about love, loss, and the unshakable bonds that define family.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-actors"><ins>Publication history</ins></h3>
        <p class="text_actors">The narrative of Locke & Key has a three-act structure, with each act covering two story arcs. Act One's first story arc, Welcome to Lovecraft, was a six-issue limited series published by IDW Publishing. The first issue of Welcome to Lovecraft was released on February 20, 2008, and sold out in a single day, requiring a second printing to be done immediately. The second arc of Act One, Head Games, commenced with the release of the first issue on January 22, 2009. The actual Head Games story was printed in four issues, with a standalone prologue ("Intermission" or "The Joe Ridgeway Story") and a standalone conclusion ("Army of One").</p>

            <p class="text_actor">The first storyline of Locke & Key Act Two, Crown of Shadows, began in late 2009. The second storyline, Keys to the Kingdom, began in August 2010.</p>
            
            <p class="text_actor">The first storyline of Act Three was announced as Time & Tide, but was retitled Clockworks. The second, and concluding, storyline is entitled Alpha & Omega.</p>
            
            <p class="text_actor">Originally, the plan was to release the first five story arcs in a monthly format with the sixth arc published as an original graphic novel. The plan changed and the concluding story arc appeared in monthly installments</p>

        <h3 class="heading-actors"><ins>Keys</ins></h3>
        <p class="text_actors">In the universe of Locke & Key, there are many keys created from whispering iron that have different magical properties. Some of them are extensively featured in the series, while others are featured very briefly. The known keys are:</p>
        <ul class="key">
            <li><b><ins>Alpha Key:</ins></b> Removes demons from possessed people's souls when inserted into their chests. It instantly turns a demon to whispering iron, so if it is still inside the host, it is fatal.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Angel Key:</ins></b> Gives the user angel-like wings that grant the ability to fly.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Animal Key:</ins></b> Used on the right door in Keyhouse, it allows the user to travel through the door and transform into an animal. (It is unclear whether they have choice in the matter. It appears that the key assigns the animal, according to some spiritual affinity.) Returning back through the door transforms a person back into a human. This works for human ghosts that have possessed animal bodies. Animals may also transform into humans if they enter through the opposite side of the door.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Anywhere Key:</ins></b> Opens a door to anywhere the bearer can visualize in their mind.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Chain Key:</ins></b> Controls the Great Lock, which guards the catacombs with entangling chains.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Echo Key:</ins></b> Allows entry to the Keyhouse well house and, with the Echo Key in hand, allows a person to return a spirit from the dead to the world of the living. Leaving through the well house door, however, banishes the spirit back to wherever it came from.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Gender Key:</ins></b>Unlocks a half-sized door between rooms which changes the sex of a person who enters it. </li>
            <li><b><ins>Ghost Key:</ins></b>When used in the right door in Keyhouse, it separates the soul from the body of whoever travels through the door. The body falls dead while their ghost is free to roam the Keyhouse grounds. Ghost souls can inhabit any other bodies nearby, and clash with other ghosts. </li>
            <li><b><ins>Giant Key:</ins></b>This physically large key, once inserted into a keyhole-shaped window in Keyhouse, transforms the bearer into a massive giant. </li>
            <li><b><ins>Grindhouse Key:</ins></b>Transforms whatever door it opens into a giant mouth that consumes whatever enters it. </li>
            <li><b><ins>Harlequin Key:</ins></b> Unlocks the Harlequin Wardrobe and allows objects not normally inside to be seen. </li>
            <li><b><ins>Head Key:</ins></b> Inserted into the base of someone's head, it allows one to peer inside the mind of a person, where memories and mental concepts (including "sanity" itself) are represented as tiny beings. The memories can be removed, and swapped between people. Books inserted into a head with the Head Key transfer their contents to the bearer of the key, though in such a situation the knowledge of the text is accurate but superficial.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Hell Key:</ins></b> The bearer is automatically the Lord of Hell and has absolute control over Hell.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Hercules Key:</ins></b>Embedded in a necklace, it grants the bearer considerable strength and bulk. </li>
            <li><b><ins>Identity Key:</ins></b> Upon inserting into the base of one's chin, the bearer can change any aspect of their appearance, including clothes, body, or even gender. Also allows a bearer to forcibly change the appearance of others.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Keyhouse Key:</ins></b> A large key which fits into a stone slab and regenerates the Keyhouse after it is destroyed.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Matchstick Key:</ins></b>Creates fires when inserted into a door or touched to an object. Can also cause self-immolation/combustion by inserting into a body. </li>
            <li><b><ins>Mending Key:</ins></b>  Opens a magical cabinet in Keyhouse into which a broken object can be placed (the cabinet can resize itself to the size of the object). Once the object is locked inside the cabinet, it is repaired. While it can heal severely wounded people, it cannot apparently resurrect the dead.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Moon Key:</ins></b> Allows the user to reach and open the Moon like a door, which allows the user to pass on to the afterlife peacefully. Inhabitants who cross the door see the living world like a stage they can observe and the afterlife like the backstage of a theater.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Music Box Key:</ins></b> nserted into a magical music box, it will cause the box to play a song that compels whomever is listening to obey its lyrics. Whoever turns the key can supply the commands. Commands are carried out so long as the music is playing and the listener can hear it.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Omega Key:</ins></b> Opens the lock on the demonic door. The first key created.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Owl Key:</ins></b>Gives the user control of a mechanical owl.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Philosophoscope Key:</ins></b>  Gives access to a device that allows viewing of various people and places.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Reali Key:</ins></b>  Allows passage to alternate dimensions.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Shadow Key:</ins></b> Allows its wearer to control shadow creatures, and even the shadows of other people. Shadows are capable of interacting with the material world (often violently) but can be rendered immaterial by bright light. Embedded in a crown, the key is a tremendous source of power for the wearer.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Skin Key:</ins></b>A key with a gazing mirror on its handle, it can change the race of whoever is using it.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Small World Key:</ins></b>Unlocks a dollhouse replica of Keyhouse, allowing the user to see anything in Keyhouse in realtime. Any interaction with the unlocked dollhouse also occurs within the actual house, such as a house spider entering the dollhouse magically emerging as a giant spider within the real house. </li>
            <li><b><ins>Splody Key:</ins></b>  Causes explosions in any building it is used within.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Squirrel/Undertree Key:</ins></b> Controls squirrels.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Tempus Fugit Key:</ins></b> Can turn the bearer into an older version of themselves, possibly other ages.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Timeshift Key:</ins></b>  Operates a grandfather clock that allows a user to observe (but not interact with) past events. The clock is limited to a specific time period: the earliest date one can visit is January 13, 1775, and the latest is December 31, 1999.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Teddy Bear Key:</ins></b> Animates and controls stuffed teddy bears.</li>
            <li><b><ins>Thorn Key:</ins></b> Controls plants, including for offensive purposes. This Key was redesigned and renamed the Plant Key for the Netflix series</li>
            <li><b><ins>Unnamed Riffel Key (unofficial name):</ins></b> A key created by Hans Riffel, the last person to use whispering iron before Tyler. The key is to the front door of Keyhouse Manor and implements the Riffel Rule, where no one who enters the front door of the house as an adult can directly see the power of the keys. People who age into adulthood will also begin to lose their conscious memories of the keys and their magic.</li>
